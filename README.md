# NE290-Spring2021-Nuclear-History-Politics-Futures
Repository of Materials for the UC Berkeley Spring 2021 NE290 course on Nuclear History, Politics, and Futures

The atomic bomb has changed society in fundamental ways. Total war has become unthinkable and apocalyptic, while society has gained a nearly limitless supply of energy (should we choose to exploit it). Please join us twice weekly (Tue & Thurs 3:30-5:00PM) as we trace the history of the nuclear revolution from Medieval tin mines to the ongoing race to nuclear fusion. 


## NE290D Course Description:

This course provides an overview of the history of nuclear energy and its interaction with society. It seeks to contextualize the importance of the field at its inception, in current affairs, and in future endeavors. Understanding this history is paramount in internalizing a sense of respect for the fruits of an unlocked atom, as well as its perils.

This class will focus on the history of key developments in the nuclear field, especially those with exceptional relevance to current affairs. We will begin with 20th-century developments in fundamental physics, the Radium era and the lead-up to the Manhattan project, and its oft-ignored foreign counterparts. We will then explore the early atomic age with a look at how the growing tension with the Soviets led to the arms race that dominated foreign policy for decades. Proceeding chronologically, we will discuss the era of strategic bombers, the development of the nuclear submarine, the space race, and the hydrogen bomb (and controversy surrounding it). While we walk along the timeline of key events, we will be exploring the sociological and humanistic aspects of our field through literature that speaks to the tolls of the nuclear complex, nuclear testing, and the growing disillusionment and terror inspired by nuclear technology. We will also explore the neutron bomb, nuclear winter, and the evolution of modern nuclear arsenals.

## Readings

Readings for the course will be are described in the initial timeline following this basic syllabus. The readings are broken down by week and lecture to help paint a picture for the class direction throughout the semester. All students are expected to have an understanding of all of the readings. The syllabus will be updated frequently.




## Assignments and Grading

The class will be graded based on the following:

Weekly Reading Responses 30\%
Class Participation 20\%
Term Paper 50\%

Students will be expected to provide a thoughtful, weekly response of ~1 page to the reading materials. We will be reading these responses. Each week, a random selection of students will be asked to share their responses with the class to foster a discussion, so students will need to be prepared to engage and discuss both the literature and their interpretation of it. Assigned reading will be accompanied with either a short quiz given the day before class via bCourses or with a Jeopardy! Match at the start of class. The point of these quizzes is to help students internalize important aspects of the literature. Since class participation factors into your final grade, please read!

In the middle of the course, we will break into teams and select a topic on which we will endeavor to write a scholarly article that examines the history, politics, and future of some aspect of the nuclear landscape. An individual's contribution to this final term paper will account for the bulk of the grade.




## Attendance and Participation

Obviously since class participation accounts for 25% of your grade, attendance should be considered mandatory. This class is meant to serve as a reprieve from the Nuclear Engineering department's didactic style of pedagogy; we want you to come prepared to answer and -- more importantly -- ask questions. If you cannot attend a session because of an emergency and you notify the instructor the day before class, or provide some evidence of the emergency afterward. If you cannot make the zoom-time, time can be arranged to meet with instructors to ensure a sufficient participation score!




## Academic Dishonesty & Plagiarism

As a student at Cal, you are responsible for knowing and abiding by the Student Code of Conduct (available online at here. All work submitted by you and that bears your name is presumed to be your own, original work. You may use others' words or ideas only if you attribute them properly. This means that you identify the original source and extent of your use of the words or ideas of others that you use.

This goal of this course is to improve your critical reading, thinking and writing skills. My accurate evaluation of these skills involves the assumption that your words and ideas are your own. Therefore, using other people's ideas as your own, in addition to being forbidden in the Student Code of Conduct, interferes with the aims of this course; hence my zero- tolerance policy regarding plagiarism. Using words or ideas that are not your own without attributing them, whether in your papers or in-class writing assignments is unacceptable. Not to mention that those who rely on others' ideas, rather than taking the intellectual risk and challenge to develop their own, will not improve as writers and thinkers and will thus probably fail even if they don't get caught. If you are unsure of the expectations for completing an assignment, just ask before you turn in your work! We are more than happy to discuss these matters with you.




## ADA and DSP Accommodations 

"No one, on the basis of their disability, may be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any UC Berkeley program or activity. The ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)/504 Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring that the policies and procedures developed by the campus comply with federal, state, and University requirements. The ADA/504 Compliance Officer serves as a resource to those with disabilities who believe that they are not receiving appropriate accommodations or that they are being treated in a discriminatory manner. In addition, the ADA/504 Compliance Officer may set aside or modify an accommodation that is under dispute."(https://compliance.berkeley.edu/responsibilities-guide/disability-services) 

The teaching team will take all necessary steps to ensure the classroom and course-related activities are ADA accessible. Please contact the teaching team with any concerns with regard to this. 

The UC Berkeley Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) (http://dsp.berkeley.edu) provides students with disabilities accommodations to ensure equal opportunity in the classroom. The policy of the university is that testing and teaching accommodations may only be provided to students with a DSP certified Letter of Accommodation. Students with DSP accommodations are encouraged to contact the teaching team as soon as possible to arrange their accommodations. Students with disabilities that have not been provided a Letter of Accommodation by DSP and encouraged to contact DSP as soon as possible, the teaching team can only provide interim accommodations if allowed to do so by DSP. 




### Inclusivity and a Safe Environment
